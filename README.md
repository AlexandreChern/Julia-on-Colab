<br/>A Notebook for running Julia 1.3.1 on Google Collab using the IJulia package

# Why?

When I started Julia few months back I was searching for an IDE or NoteBook to run Julia efficiently, and I struggled to get a GPU functioning on my own computer. *There were no websites offering free cloud computing for Julia*. I searched the Julia Discourse and Slack for weeks and after much trial and error I came up with this solution. **I thought it would be nice to share so that other beginners do not get stuck on it again.**


#### Prerequisites:
A Google account, that's all.

## **Using the Notebook**
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running:
- Open the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Dsantra92/Julia-on-Collab/blob/master/julia_on_collab.ipynb)
- You can either download it or view it directly on Google Collab
- Run the first cell to install Julia and IJulia
### Note to the user:
Since Google does not directly offer Julia based computing you have to take care:
- You need to **work on the same notebook** to get access to Julia 1.3 kernel.
- **You might lose connection to the host and after reconnecting you might lose your Julia packages that were installed.** To tackle this situation re-run the first cell and proceed with the follow up instructions in the notebook.
- If you want to create your own notebook I would suggest you **use this a base Notebook and then work on it.**
## Contributing
I got help from a lot of people on the [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) and [Slack](https://slackinvite.julialang.org/). It is because of them this notebook is possible. I want to thank these communities and encourage you to participate in them.
